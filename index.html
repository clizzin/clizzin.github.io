      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>I'm just this person, you know?</p>
      <p>What I enjoy most is writing and performing experimental two-minute plays for <a href="http://sfneofuturists.com">The San Francisco Neo-Futurists</a> as part of our weekly show, The Infinite Wrench. I also teach web development at <a href="http://www.missionbit.com">Mission Bit</a>, which is great fun.</p>
      <p>My favorite movie is <em>Do the Right Thing</em>, written and directed by Spike Lee.</p>
      <p>My favorite books are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><em>The Argonauts</em> by Maggie Nelson</li>
        <li><em>The Sound and the Fury</em> by William Faulkner</li>
        <li><em>The Autobiography of Malcolm X</em> by Malcolm X (with Alex Haley)</li>
        <li><em>Blankets</em> by Craig Thompson</li>
        <li><em>The Savage Detectives</em> by Roberto BolaÃ±o (originally <em>Los detectives salvajes)</em></li>
      </ul>
      <p>I like learning languages:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Mandarin (ä¸­æ–‡):</strong> I can speak this proficiently but don't know how to read or write.</li>
        <li><strong>French (FranÃ§ais):</strong> I am proficient after living for two years in Senegal, a Francophone country in West Africa.</li>
        <li><strong>Spanish (EspaÃ±ol):</strong> I am learning this now!</li>
      </ul>
      <p>I grew up in Fremont and now live in the Potrero neighborhood of San Francisco.</p>

      <p>I have written many two-minute plays. They include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>a very artistic and mystical tattoo</li>
        <li>ðŸ”ŒDANGER!!!!!!! HIGH VOLTAGE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! ðŸ”Œ</li>
        <li>Americana Cowboy Reboot</li>
        <li>Butting In: A Tribute to Vikram, My College Roommate, Who Literally Did This to Me All the Time</li>
        <li>A Visit With the Ex</li>
        <li>Market Research for the Canned Tuna Industry, featuring actual quotations from the Wall Street Journal</li>
      </ul>
      <p>I have also written an essay titled "Selling Out" that will be published later in 2019.</p>
      <p>And I wrote this website. My best work, really. Someone give me that Pulitzer.</p>

          Had rehearsal at Shotgun Studios for the Heart Wrench show <a href="http://www.sfneofuturists.com/">The SF Neo-Futurists</a> are doing this week for Valentine's Day. It was a pretty fun rehearsal. I enjoyed seeing Margaret, Siyu, and Amy's delight at how old some of the plays we resurrected were.

          Now I'm reviewing CSS Flexbox stuff in preparation for class tomorrow. Huurrrrrrrah. I made this blog as a simple example of how to use various basic elements of HTML and CSS. Do you think it does the job?

        <p>
          Went to Beginning Contemporary Dance class at <a href="https://www.odc.dance/">ODC</a> after skipping last week. Kristin was great, as usual. I also saw Eugenia there. The song we danced to was "Bamboo Banga" by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M.I.A._(rapper)">M.I.A.</a>, which I'm sure I've heard before but somehow never noticed.
        </p>

        <p>
          Yeah! Pretty sweet song!
        </p>
        <p>
          It reminded me of the documentary I watched about M.I.A. at the <a href="https://www.roxie.com/">Roxie</a> a few months ago, the one contained all that video footage she shot when she was young and thought she would become a documentary filmmaker.
