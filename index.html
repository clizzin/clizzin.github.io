      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>I'm just this person, you know?</p>
      <p>What I enjoy most is writing and performing experimental two-minute plays for <a href="http://sfneofuturists.com">The San Francisco Neo-Futurists</a> as part of our weekly show, The Infinite Wrench. I also teach web development at <a href="http://www.missionbit.com">Mission Bit</a>, which is great fun.</p>
      <p>My favorite movie is <em>Do the Right Thing</em>, written and directed by Spike Lee.</p>
      <p>My favorite books are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><em>The Argonauts</em> by Maggie Nelson</li>
        <li><em>The Sound and the Fury</em> by William Faulkner</li>
        <li><em>The Autobiography of Malcolm X</em> by Malcolm X (with Alex Haley)</li>
        <li><em>Blankets</em> by Craig Thompson</li>
        <li><em>The Savage Detectives</em> by Roberto BolaÃ±o (originally <em>Los detectives salvajes)</em></li>
      </ul>
      <p>I like learning languages:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Mandarin (ä¸­æ–‡):</strong> I can speak this proficiently but don't know how to read or write.</li>
        <li><strong>French (FranÃ§ais):</strong> I am proficient after living for two years in Senegal, a Francophone country in West Africa.</li>
        <li><strong>Spanish (EspaÃ±ol):</strong> I am learning this now!</li>
      </ul>
      <p>I grew up in Fremont and now live in the Potrero neighborhood of San Francisco.</p>

      </ul>
      <p>I have also written an essay titled "Selling Out" that will be published later in 2019.</p>
      <p>And I wrote this website. My best work, really. Someone give me that Pulitzer.</p>
