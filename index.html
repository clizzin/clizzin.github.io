          Had rehearsal at Shotgun Studios for the Heart Wrench show <a href="http://www.sfneofuturists.com/">The SF Neo-Futurists</a> are doing this week for Valentine's Day. It was a pretty fun rehearsal. I enjoyed seeing Margaret, Siyu, and Amy's delight at how old some of the plays we resurrected were.

          Now I'm reviewing CSS Flexbox stuff in preparation for class tomorrow. Huurrrrrrrah.

          Went to Beginning Contemporary Dance class at <a href="https://www.odc.dance/">ODC</a> after skipping last week. Kristin was great, as usual. I also saw Eugenia there. The song we danced to was "Bamboo Banga" by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M.I.A._(rapper)">M.I.A.</a>, which I'm sure I've heard before but somehow never noticed.

        <p>
          Yeah! Pretty sweet song!
        </p>
        <p>
          It reminded me of the documentary I watched about M.I.A. at the <a href="https://www.roxie.com/">Roxie</a> a few months ago, the one contained all that video footage she shot when she was young and thought she would become a documentary filmmaker.
