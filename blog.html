          Had rehearsal at Shotgun Studios for the Heart Wrench show <a href="http://www.sfneofuturists.com/">The SF Neo-Futurists</a> are doing this week for Valentine's Day. It was a pretty fun rehearsal. I enjoyed seeing Margaret, Siyu, and Amy's delight at how old some of the plays we resurrected were.

          Now I'm reviewing CSS Flexbox stuff in preparation for class tomorrow. Huurrrrrrrah. I made this blog as a simple example of how to use various basic elements of HTML and CSS. Do you think it does the job?

          Went to Beginning Contemporary Dance class at <a href="https://www.odc.dance/">ODC</a> after skipping last week. Kristin was great, as usual. I also saw Eugenia there. The song we danced to was "Bamboo Banga" by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M.I.A._(rapper)">M.I.A.</a>, which I'm sure I've heard before but somehow never noticed.

          Yeah! Pretty sweet song!
          </p>
          <p>
          It reminded me of the documentary I watched about M.I.A. at the <a href="https://www.roxie.com/">Roxie</a> a few months ago, the one contained all that video footage she shot when she was young and thought she would become a documentary filmmaker.
