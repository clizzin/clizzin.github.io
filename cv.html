      <h4>üê¨ Summary</h4>
      <p>
        I have about seven years of professional software engineering
        experience, from 2010&ndash;2016. Most of those years were spent at
        Airbnb, where I joined as the 11th engineer and took on many different
        projects during the company's hypergrowth years.  I now primarily write
        code as a hobby, but I am open to short-term contracts for projects
        that are artistic in nature or that advance progressive causes.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm most proficient with web backends and data store design. I'm also
        comfortable with devops,  as well as with frontend web development.
        My knowledge in these areas is a little out of date&mdash;I am not
        familiar with Docker or React, for example&mdash;but I am pretty quick
        at picking things up. Most recently, I learned Vue and Firebase in a
        few days for a small project.
      </p>
      <p>
        My sweet spot is at the intersection of product and engineering. I
        especially like cranking out quick prototypes that can nevertheless
        serve as the foundation for a more fleshed-out, scalable product. I am
        a huge fan of documentation and good written communication, and I also
        strongly value web accessibility.

      <h4>üìÅ Work Experience</h4>

      <h5>Airbnb</h4>
      <em>April 2011 &ndash; April 2016</em>
      <p>
        This is the bulk of my software career experience. I joined as the 11th
        engineer and took on many projects during the company's hypergrowth
        years.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>First data infrastructure engineer, built a Hadoop-based event log storage and querying system</li>
        <li>
          Started the Developer Tools team, decreased build/test/deploy time
          on our monolithic Rails application from 30 minutes to 10
          minutes. You can watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4etQ8s74aHg">a talk</a>
          that my colleague and I gave about this work.
        </li>
        <li>Led development on the first iteration of Airbnb Experiences</li>
        <li>Active member of the SysOps team, which handled on-call duty for all services</li>
        <li>Worked on the Growth and Host product teams. Implemented re-designs of host tools and signup/login flow</li>
      </ul>

      <h5>San Francisco Neo-Futurists</h5>
      <em>December 2017&ndash;present</em>
      <p>
        This is my main commitment nowadays. It's not a software job; it's a
        theater company for which I write and perform experimental two-minute
        plays. I serve as Co-Artistic Director and do administrative work in
        that capacity. I recently made a website for our COVID-era show:
        <a href="https://world-wide-wrench.web.app">sfneofuturists.org/world-wide-wrench</a>.
      </p>

      <h5>Oolu</h5>
      <em>Summer 2017</em>
      <p>
        Oolu is an off-grid solar distribution and financing company in West
        Africa. I did a contract gig with them to set up automated reporting
        for business data and also assisted in the deployment of their call
        center software.
